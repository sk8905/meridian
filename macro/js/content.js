      "The FOMC held its target range at <strong>3.50–3.75%</strong> on 17 June 2026 — a fourth consecutive hold, by a 12–0 vote, and the first meeting chaired by Kevin Warsh. The effective fed funds rate sits near <strong>3.63%</strong>. The June Summary of Economic Projections shifted the median year-end-2026 dot up to roughly <strong>3.8%</strong> (from 3.4% in March), with nine of nineteen participants now pencilling in at least one further <em>hike</em> this year — a hawkish pivot from the earlier easing bias.",
      "The driver is re-accelerating inflation: <strong>core PCE hit 3.4% in May</strong>, its highest since October 2023, pushed by tariff pass-through and an energy shock tied to Middle-East tensions. Growth and the labour market remain solid, removing the case for cuts, though some economists argue tariff effects may be near their peak.",
      "For the 28–29 July meeting, a Reuters poll (72 of 102 economists) and futures markets overwhelmingly expect a <strong>hold</strong>. Through year-end, fed funds futures price the rate drifting toward <strong>~3.8% by October and near 4% by December</strong> — about one 25bp hike. J.P. Morgan sees no move in 2026; Deutsche Bank expects two hikes (September and December).",

      "<strong>Services inflation was 3.7% in May</strong> (up from 3.2%), the MPC's key persistence gauge, while headline CPI held at <strong>2.8%</strong>. Labour data is softening — regular pay (AWE ex-bonus) growth around <strong>3.4%</strong>, unemployment <strong>4.9%</strong> and a rising claimant count — pointing to gradually easing wage pressure, which tempers the hawks.",
      "Markets expect the Bank to <strong>hold at 3.75% for the rest of 2026</strong>. A Reuters poll of 65 economists found most see a year-end hold, but nearly 40% price at least one hike and only six a cut; 2026 forecasts span 3.50–4.25%. The base case for the 30 July meeting is a hold with a hawkish tilt.",

    "Ray Dalio distinguishes the <strong>short-term debt cycle</strong> — the ordinary business cycle of roughly six years, driven by central banks tightening to curb inflation then easing to revive growth — from the <strong>long-term “Big Debt Cycle”</strong> of ~50–75 years, in which each short cycle leaves debt a little higher until the burden becomes unsustainable. He describes a progression from sound money → leveraging and debt bubble → top → deleveraging → new equilibrium, the best resolution being a <em>“beautiful deleveraging”</em> that balances restructuring and money-printing so nominal growth outruns nominal rates.",
    "His 2025 book <em>How Countries Go Broke: The Big Cycle</em> formalises this and applies it to the United States. Dalio's documented 2025–26 warning: the US must cut its deficit to about <strong>3% of GDP</strong> or risk a bond-market “heart attack” — rising rates feeding weaker demand for Treasuries feeding still-higher rates — within roughly three years.",

CBO's February 2026 outlook puts the FY2026 deficit at <strong>$1.9tn (5.8% of GDP)</strong>, debt held by the public at <strong>~101% of GDP</strong>, and net interest at a record <strong>~$1.0tn (3.3% of GDP)</strong> — the compounding interest-service and heavy issuance Dalio warns about.",
