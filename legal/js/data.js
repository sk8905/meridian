  c01: "A Russian bankruptcy trustee sought to reach a London townhouse owned by the bankrupt. The Supreme Court held that the long-standing 'immovables rule' prevents a foreign insolvency from affecting English land, which is governed by the law of its situs and falls outside the foreign bankruptcy. The decision preserves an important territorial limit on cross-border insolvency assistance.",
  c02: "Centrica incurred professional fees on the disposal of a loss-making subsidiary and claimed them as deductible 'expenses of management' of its investment business. The Supreme Court held the fees were capital expenditure on a disposal and not deductible management expenses, clarifying the test. Significant for holding companies and the deductibility of deal costs.",
  c03: "A force majeure clause required the affected party to use reasonable endeavours to overcome the event; the question was whether that obliged MUR to accept payment in a non-contractual currency. The Supreme Court held reasonable endeavours do not require a party to accept non-contractual performance, so MUR could rely on force majeure. An important clarification of force-majeure and reasonable-endeavours wording in finance and commercial contracts.",
  c04: "Directors of a company that infringed trade marks were sued as joint tortfeasors and for an account of profits. The Supreme Court held a director is not liable as an accessory unless they knew the essential facts making the act wrongful, and is not personally liable to account for the company's profits. The decision limits personal director liability for company torts.",
  c05: "Liquidators of BHS sued former directors for wrongful trading and breach of duty after the retailer's collapse. The High Court found the directors liable, recognised a novel 'misfeasant trading' measure of loss and applied the Sequana creditor duty, ordering contributions exceeding £110m. A landmark warning for directors trading in the 'twilight zone' of insolvency.",
  c06: "The first appellate decision on Part 26A restructuring plans, concerning the Adler real-estate group. The Court of Appeal overturned the sanctioned plan, holding that the 'no worse off' test is not the whole story and that the restructuring surplus must be allocated fairly, with pari passu creditors generally treated equally. It set the framework for the cross-class cram down.",
  c07: "A share option was re-granted in connection with the holder's role; the issue was whether it was 'employment-related' under the statutory deeming rule. The Supreme Court held the deeming provision applied, so the option was an employment-related security taxed accordingly. Relevant to management equity and incentive structuring.",
  c08: "The question was whether litigation-funding agreements giving the funder a share of damages are 'damages-based agreements' (DBAs). The Supreme Court held they are, meaning many such agreements were unenforceable unless they complied with the DBA regime. The ruling disrupted the litigation-funding market and prompted ongoing reform efforts.",
  c09: "Mrs Philipp was tricked by fraudsters into instructing Barclays to transfer £700,000 (an authorised push-payment fraud). The Supreme Court held that a bank owes no Quincecare duty to refuse a customer's own validly authorised instruction; its primary duty is to execute instructions promptly. APP-fraud redress now runs through the PSR's mandatory reimbursement scheme rather than the common law.",
  c10: "Mozambique alleged it was the victim of bribery in the 'tuna bonds' scandal and sued; the defendants sought a stay in favour of arbitration. The Supreme Court held the bribery claims fell outside the scope of the arbitration agreements, so the dispute could proceed in court. The case gives guidance on construing the scope of arbitration clauses.",
  c11: "News Corp argued the digital editions of its newspapers should share the historic zero-rate of VAT for 'newspapers'. The Supreme Court held that, at the relevant time, the zero-rate applied only to physical newspapers, so the digital editions were standard-rated. An illustration of the 'always speaking' approach to statutory interpretation in VAT.",
  c12: "The Supreme Court confirmed the directors' 'creditor duty' — the duty to consider creditors' interests when a company is insolvent or bordering on insolvency, or an insolvent liquidation is probable. The weight given to creditors increases as the financial position worsens; it is a sliding scale rather than an on/off switch. The decision is foundational for directors of distressed companies.",
  c13: "Three customers challenged undisclosed commissions paid by lenders to the car dealers who arranged their finance. The Supreme Court held dealers owe no fiduciary or 'disinterested' duty, so bribery and secret-commission claims fail, but upheld Mr Johnson's claim that the relationship was unfair under s.140A of the Consumer Credit Act. The FCA is consulting on an industry redress scheme.",
  c14: "A Ponzi-scheme bank in liquidation alleged HSBC breached its Quincecare duty by executing payments before the fraud collapsed. The Supreme Court held that, because the payments only reduced the bank's net indebtedness, it suffered no recoverable loss. An important decision on loss and the Quincecare duty in an insolvency context.",
  c15: "Marex, a judgment creditor, sued the controller who stripped a company's assets to defeat enforcement; the issue was whether the reflective-loss rule barred the claim. The Supreme Court restated and confined the reflective-loss principle to claims by shareholders in their capacity as shareholders, so creditors are not barred. It is now the leading authority on reflective loss.",
  c16: "ClientEarth, a shareholder, sought permission to bring a derivative claim against Shell's directors over the company's climate strategy. The High Court refused permission, holding that the directors' management of competing considerations was a matter of business judgment for the board, not the court. A significant decision on directors' duties and climate litigation.",
  c17: "Mr Lloyd sought to bring an opt-out representative action for damages on behalf of millions of iPhone users over alleged data tracking. The Supreme Court held the claim could not proceed without proof of damage for each individual, blocking a US-style class action. The ruling shaped the landscape for mass data-protection claims.",
  c18: "The SFO issued a section 2 notice compelling a US parent company to produce documents held abroad. The Supreme Court held that section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1987 has no extraterritorial effect over foreign companies. The case is a key limit on the SFO's evidence-gathering powers in cross-border investigations.",
  c19: "One of the first restructuring plans under Part 26A, involving group companies in the subsea-engineering sector. The court exercised the new cross-class cram down for the first time to bind a dissenting class of creditors. A foundational decision for the restructuring-plan tool.",
  c20: "Virgin Active's gym business proposed a plan compromising landlord claims across different classes. The court sanctioned the plan and crammed down dissenting landlords, focusing on the 'relevant alternative' of administration in which they would recover little. An influential early decision for landlord compromises.",
  c21: "An oil company proposed a debt-for-equity plan that would heavily dilute its shareholders. The court refused to sanction it, declining to cram down shareholders where it was not shown they were 'out of the money' in the relevant alternative. The case showed the limits of the cross-class cram down.",
  c22: "A property-management SME proposed a restructuring plan opposed by HMRC as a preferential creditor. The court sanctioned the plan and crammed down HMRC — the first plan to do so — extending the tool to smaller companies. A milestone for SME restructurings.",
  c23: "The case concerned whether charges over a satellite operator's assets were fixed or floating despite limited chargee control. The court held that certain assets were subject to a fixed charge, taking a broader view than some had expected. It reopened the fixed/floating-charge debate that is central to lender priority.",
  c24: "A creditor invoked section 423 of the Insolvency Act (transactions defrauding creditors) where the debtor had caused a company he controlled to dispose of assets. The Supreme Court held section 423 can apply even though the assets were owned by the company rather than the debtor personally. The decision widens the reach of this anti-avoidance provision.",
  c25: "The taxpayer used short-term loan arrangements intended to avoid the obligation to withhold income tax on 'yearly interest'. The Court of Appeal held the interest was yearly interest with a UK source, so the withholding obligation applied. Important for the design of lending structures and withholding tax.",
  c26: "HMRC argued that part-time football referees were employees for tax, turning on mutuality of obligation and control. The Supreme Court held that mutuality and a sufficient framework of control can exist within individual engagements, and remitted the case. A leading modern authority on employment status.",
  c28: "Part of long-running group litigation over the UK's taxation of foreign dividends contrary to EU law. The Supreme Court addressed limitation periods and the availability of mistake-of-law restitution claims. Significant for tax-restitution claims and the running of limitation.",
  c29: "A foreign-exchange trading LLP used a scheme routing trading profits through a corporate member before paying them to individual members as deferred 'special capital'. The Supreme Court held the amounts were taxable as the individual members' income, confirming the courts below. A landmark on LLP remuneration structuring and the limits of purposive tax interpretation.",
  c30: "Petrofac's Part 26A plans were sanctioned at first instance over dissenting creditors. The Court of Appeal set the sanction aside, holding that meeting the 'no worse off' test is not enough — the restructuring surplus must be allocated fairly between classes. The decision raised the evidential bar for the cross-class cram down.",
  c31: "Thames Water's Part 26A plan provided emergency liquidity to the regulated water utility; objectors argued special administration better served the public interest. The Court of Appeal upheld the sanction, holding the plan met the statutory tests and that public interest had only a limited role in the discretion. A high-profile application of the plan to a regulated monopoly.",
  c32: "A shareholders' agreement required the company to work in good faith towards an exit; the chairman concealed from the board that no sale was being pursued. The Court of Appeal found this breached the s.172 duty to promote the company's success, even absent personal gain, and supported unfair-prejudice relief. A practical decision on directors' honesty with the board.",
  c33: "A Chinese property developer used an English restructuring plan to compromise debt governed partly by Hong Kong law. The court sanctioned the plan and applied the cross-class cram down where over 75% of a class had approved and liquidation was the relevant alternative. The case illustrates the plan's cross-border reach.",
  c34: "A 2026 restructuring-plan sanction in the energy-production sector. The court applied the post-Petrofac fairness framework, scrutinising the allocation of the restructuring surplus and the treatment of dissenting creditors before sanctioning the plan. A recent example of plan practice after the Court of Appeal's fairness guidance.",
  c35: "Shares held on trust were transferred in breach of trust to a Saudi bank, and the beneficiaries sued for knowing receipt. The Supreme Court held there was no liability because the claimant's equitable proprietary interest was extinguished on the transfer under the governing (Saudi) law. A leading authority on knowing receipt and cross-border property.",
  c36: "Between 2001 and 2006 Dexia entered into 11 interest rate swap transactions with the City of Turin totalling around €400m, hedging the municipality's variable-rate bond obligations. When interest rates fell for over a decade Turin sought to invalidate the swaps in Italian proceedings, arguing non-disclosure of mark-to-market values and implicit costs under the Cattolica doctrine, and constitutional and civil-code defects. Mr Justice Andrew Baker rejected each argument in full and granted Dexia comprehensive declaratory relief at a trial Turin chose not to attend. He held that Turin's swaps were straightforward hedges — not complex aleatory contracts requiring Cattolica-style disclosure — that express ISDA Master Agreement language ruling out an advisory role protected the bank, and that Turin as a professional investor could not invoke retail-client protections; Turin's non-attendance generated a substantial costs liability and final declarations deployable in Italian enforcement.",
  c37: "Iconic Sports Eagle Investment LLC held a put option over a substantial minority stake (aggregate value exceeding US$100 million) in Eagle Football Holdings Limited, which owns stakes in Olympique Lyonnais and Botafogo FR. After the defendant Textor repudiated the put option agreement, Iconic brought a claim for specific performance and the case raised two issues remitted by the Court of Appeal: whether Iconic was barred from advancing the 'Snell Point' (that a party need only show readiness and willingness to perform at the date of the specific performance order) and whether that point was correct in law. Deputy Judge Anderson KC held that Iconic was not estopped from advancing the argument and that the principle in Snell's Equity — permitting a claimant to demonstrate readiness at the judgment date rather than the contractual completion date when the counterparty has repudiated — correctly states English law. The decision provides practical authority for M&A and private equity practitioners whose clients face repudiation of share option or SPA obligations, confirming that inability to complete on the original timetable does not defeat a specific performance claim where the defendant caused the default.",
  c38: "Hipgnosis Music Limited alleged its former director, Merck Mercuriadis, diverted the company's business of acquiring music royalty catalogues by pursuing an essentially identical model through Hipgnosis Songs Fund Limited (HSFL2), which completed a successful £202 million IPO in July 2018 after the original vehicle failed. Adam Johnson J held that Mercuriadis breached the s.175 CA 2006 duty to avoid conflicts of interest: the corporate opportunity had not been approved or abandoned by the company, and he exploited it through different corporate structures for personal gain, engaging the continuing duties imposed by s.170(2)(a) CA 2006 on former directors. The successor vehicle HSFL2 and its associated management company were found to be accessories to the breach and jointly liable to account for profits. The decision is an important modern statement on the corporate opportunity doctrine and the reach of post-directorship fiduciary obligations under English law.",
  c39: "Bank of India sought to enforce a personal guarantee signed by Nirav Modi — the fugitive Indian diamantaire held at HMP Thameside — securing USD $4.1 million owed by his company Firestar Diamond FZE. The Commercial Court (Tinkler DJ) rejected Modi's argument that the guarantee was void under Indian foreign-exchange regulations (FEMA): the Reserve Bank of India may grant retrospective approval, and the obligation to obtain it rests on the guarantor, not the bank. The court also confirmed that SOFR-based rates replace synthetic LIBOR under the facility documentation following that benchmark's cessation in September 2024, and held that Modi had been validly served with the October 2025 demand notice. Judgment was entered for Bank of India in full.",
  c40: "Deutsche Glasfaser Group GmbH — Germany's leading FTTH fibre-optic infrastructure provider — faced €162m in interest due 30 June 2026 and proposed a creditor scheme of arrangement under s.899 CA 2006 bifurcating its ~€7bn of existing debt into structurally senior opco debt and structurally subordinated holdco debt, alongside a new €400m super-senior facility and an €845m equity injection from EQT and OMERS. Mr Justice Adam Johnson sanctioned the scheme on 24 June 2026, noting that 98 of 100 creditors attended the meeting and voted unanimously in favour, with scheme-scenario recovery (60.8–91.8 cents/€) materially superior to a distressed liquidation (34.2–48.8 cents/€). A last-minute German tax ruling received on 16 June 2026 introduced conditionality over the implementation mechanism, but the court held this did not prevent sanction; the scheme remains binding pending resolution of that point by 24 August 2026. This is a companion to [2026] EWHC 1467 (Ch) (the convening hearing) and confirms the continuing utility of English Part 26 schemes — distinct from Part 26A restructuring plans — for cross-border restructurings of German-incorporated groups with English law-governed facilities.",
