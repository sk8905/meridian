# Baby Tracker — development & guidance

A private, offline-first, **zero-build** single-page app to track a baby's
development, sleep, feeding, milk, weaning/allergens, growth, vaccinations,
health checks and the nursery/school timeline — grounded in **UK (NHS/UKHSA),
Irish (HSE) and French (ameli/sante.gouv)** guidance.

This repository is a **standalone deployment** of the app: it is completely
independent — no shared code, auth, or links with any other project. The whole
app is the single file [`index.html`](index.html). All data stays in the
browser (`localStorage`); there is JSON export/import for backup.

## Run it

- **Locally:** double-click `index.html` — works fully offline.
- **Hosted:** see Cloudflare Pages steps below (recommended for a private repo),
  or any static host.

## Deploy on Cloudflare Pages (recommended) + your own login

> This is **separate** from any other site — its own project, its own login.

### 1. Create the Pages project
1. <https://dash.cloudflare.com> → **Workers & Pages → Create → Pages →
   Connect to Git**.
2. Authorise GitHub and pick this repository
   (`sk8905/little-steps-baby-tracker`).
3. Build settings:
   - **Framework preset:** None
   - **Build command:** *(leave blank)*
   - **Build output directory:** `/`
4. **Save and Deploy** → you get a URL like
   `https://little-steps-baby-tracker.pages.dev`.

### 2. Lock it to just you (Cloudflare Access — a NEW, separate application)
1. Dashboard → **Zero Trust** (free; set a team name if asked).
2. **Access → Applications → Add an application → Self-hosted.**
   - **Name:** Little Steps
   - **Application domain:** your `*.pages.dev` host (and a custom domain if you
     add one).
3. **Add a policy:** Action **Allow**, Include → **Emails** → your email (add
   your partner's too). This is its **own** policy, unrelated to any other app.
4. **Login method:** default **One-time PIN** (emailed code) needs no setup;
   Google/GitHub login optional.
5. Save. Now the site shows a login screen and only your listed emails can enter.

### 3. (Optional) Custom domain
Pages project → **Custom domains** → add e.g. `littlesteps.yourdomain.com`, then
add that hostname to the Access application above so it's gated too.

Ages, doses and schedules are general guides from public sources and change over
time. Always follow your GP, health visitor, PHN or paediatrician, and your Red
Book / carnet de santé. Schedules were checked against official sources around
June 2026 — re-verify before acting on dates.
